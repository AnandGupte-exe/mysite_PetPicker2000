                The first step is to ask the user for data
              </p>
              <p>
                and I did that by making sliders which people
              </p>
              <p>
                can move to select there number for each question.
              </p>
              <p>
                We also need data for each animal. After we
              </p>
              <p>
                have the user data and the animal data we need
              </p>
              <p>
                to scale the data. We do this by finding the
              </p>
              <p>
                maximum value for each question. Then we divide
              </p>
              <p>
                each number in that question by the max number.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once everything is scaled we plot each animal point
              </p>
              <p>
                using each question value as a coordinate. So there
              </p>
              <p>
                are 1 dimension for each question. After that we
              </p>
              <p>
                plot the users data. Then we find the euclidean
              </p>
              <p>
                distance () to find the distance between each point
              </p>
              <p>
                and the users point. Then we look for the smallest
              </p>
              <p>
                distance and that is the best fitting animal.
